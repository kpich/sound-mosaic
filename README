A little project to slice up a source soundfile and a destination soundfile and try to recreate the destination soundfile as faithfully as possible using pieces of the source soundfile.

This project is written in python and uses Marsyas ( http://marsyas.info/ ) and SoX ( http://sox.sourceforge.net/ ).

You must have marsyas and sox installed on your system and the various executables (namely bextract, kea, and sox) on your path.

To run this, first create a marsyas collection with the source and destination wavfiles labeled "source" and "dest", then call
    python make-sound-mosaic.py --collection=coll.mf --windowsize=100 --output=foo
and you'll get three files:
    *'output/foo.wav': the stitched-together wavfile trying to sound like dest.
    *'output/foo.arff': the feature vectors for each window of the input file, labeled with either "source" or "dest"
    *'output/foo-matrix.txt': the n x n triangular matrix representing distances between all the different windows

More information about Marsyas can be found in the Marsyas user manual http://marsyas.info/docs/manual/marsyas-user/index.html
